								Last month I found myself struggling while understanding python sockets. So I decided to
								make a project to understand it. After trying out basic examples and reading the docs, I 
								got to making a chat application.
							</p>
							<p>Here's the Github link for the repository : <a href="url">pychatbox</a>
							</p>
							<p>
								At first, I wanted to make it a simple terminal based application but after writing some code,
								it became clear that a terminal won't suffice. I switched to tkinter and ended up making a 
								GUI for the app. Keep in mind, GUI became a necessity, which is a strange thing for me!
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>What new are you going to learn?</strong>
								<p>If you're a newbie like me, there's probably a lot to learn from this project.
									Here's a list of what you will learn:
									<li>Sockets</li>
									<li>Multi-Threaded Programs and solving related problems</li>
									<li>Securing transmitted data using Crypto</li>
									<li>Building a tkinter GUI</li>
									<li>Using Sqlite databases</li>
								</p>
								<p>Lot to learn! Let's get going!</p>
								</p>
							</p>
							<p>
								<h3>Starting out with sockets</h3>
								<p>
									For learning the basics of sockets, you can read the docs, or look youtube
									videos. Basics are very thorughly explained in the internet and I'm going to do
									no good by reinventing the wheel! But for the sake of completeness, here's a simple
									server and client sockets code, that does nothing more than saying hello and closing connections.
									<h4>Simple echo server</h4>
								<pre class="prettyprint">
import socket

host = ''
port = 5555

with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM) as server_sock:

	server_sock.bind((host,port))  	# bind to a host on some port
	server_sock.listen()		# listen for incoming connections
	print("Listening for connections...") 
	conn, addr = server_sock.accept()  	# create a NEW socket object upon accepting connection with a specifie address
	
	with conn:
		conn.send(b"Welcome, client!")  	# send bytes-like data over the new socket object
		dataRcvd = conn.recv(1024)  	# recieve data from the client
		if not dataRcvd:		# tricky part. If no data is recieved close the connection.
			print("Connection closed by the client")
			conn.close()
		else:
			print(dataRcvd.decode("utf-8"))  	# print the recieved message by decoding it to utf-8
			conn.close()

								</pre>

								<h3>Simple echo client</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint">
import socket

host = ""  	# Enter the host IP address here (IPv4)
port = 5555		# Anything above 1000 should work fine

with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as client_socket:

	client_socket.connect((host,port))
	dataRcvd = client_socket.recv(1024)

	if not dataRcvd:
		print("Connection closed by the server")
		client_socket.close()
	else:
		print(dataRcvd.decode("utf-8"))

	client_socket.send(b"Hello, server!")
	client_socket.close()
</pre>
								Here's how the server code runs.
								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/echo_server.PNG" alt="" /></a>
								<p> Nice! Now we can go forward and do more complex things with sockets. </p>
								
							</p>
							<p>
								<h3>Is it hacker-proof?</h3>
								If you've ever used Wireshark (A network traffic monitoring tool), you'll find out that these messages
								that we sent using the echo server travel plaintext over the network! This is unacceptable, and we should
								make our messaging more secure and tamper proof. To do this, we can use two ways of encryption:
								<li>Symmetric encryption : Share a common key on both sides of the network for locking and unlocking messages</li>
								<li>Asymmetric encryption : Use SSL/TLS measures to secure socket connections</li>
								I implemented both in my program, just for the sake of learning. Any one should suffice, but be cautious about
								the pros and cons.
							</p>
							<p><h3>More workers = less work?</h3>
								Yes, it does mean that work will be distributed, but the total work remains same. 
								<p>Let's thread everything to make it faster!</p>
								<p>No! It doesn't work that way. Threading is an optimal solution when you are waiting for
									some work to finish, while you want to switch to another task. Some people complain about threading
									in Python to be "bad", but if you code as per the docs, you'll be fine.
									So again, threading is a nice idea in situations like putting marbles in a jar; more the workers, easier is the task.
								</p>
								<h3>An example of how threading can help</h3>
								Let's bring back our echo server and make a few changes: let's make it listen for client messages endlessly, just like 
								a normal server would do. Let's define a function 'foo' that'll print 'foo' 5 times and call it after running the while loop
								for listening for messages from the client.
<pre class="prettyprint">
def fooPrint():
	for _ in range(5):
		print("foo")
</pre>
						and modify the server code to run a while loop infinitely to recieve messages.
<pre class="prettyprint">
	with conn:
		try:
			while True:
				dataRcvd = conn.recv(1024)  	# recieve data from the client
				if not dataRcvd:		# tricky part. If no data is recieved close the connection.
					print("Connection closed by the client")
					conn.close()
				else:
					time.sleep(0.1)
		except:
			print("Connection closed by the client!")

fooPrint()
</pre>
							Now we will modify the client code to send messages using a while loop.
<pre class="prettyprint">
while True:
    client_socket.send(b"Hello client!")
</pre>
					On running the server code, we see this output:
					<p>
						
					</p>		
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/no_thread.PNG" alt="" /></a>
							But we can't see the 'foo' printed 5 times (or even a single time). This happens because the function is stuck in the while loop.
							So the <strong>'main thread'</strong> is busy recieving messages and doesn't reach the foo function. To solve this issue, we
							can have an alternate thread handle the reception, while the main thread will continue as it should. We can modify the server code as follows:
<pre class="prettyprint">
def recvMessages(conn):
    try:
        while True:
            dataRcvd = conn.recv(1024)  	# recieve data from the client
            if not dataRcvd:		# tricky part. If no data is recieved close the connection.
                print("Connection closed by the client")
                conn.close()
            else:
                time.sleep(0.1)
    except:
        print("Connection closed by the client!")
</pre>
Now let's change the code to start a thread for recieving the messages
<pre class="prettyprint">
server_sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server_sock.setblocking(1)
server_sock.bind((host, port))  	# bind to a host on some port
server_sock.listen()		# listen for incoming connections
print("Listening for connections...")
conn, addr = server_sock.accept()

recvThread = Thread(target=recvMessages,args=(conn,))       # create a thread for the recieve function
recvThread.start()      # start the thread

fooPrint()
recvThread.join()       # once the recvMessage function returns, we'll release the thread's allocated sources
</pre>
Now when we run this code, we can see that foo prints immediately.

							<h3>Managing multiple threads at the same time</h3>
							<p>
								If you're looking to develop a program with multiple threads, it is recommended to manage a queue from
								different threads and have the main thread read the queue every while.
								
								Here's how this app manages multiple clients.
